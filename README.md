# An integrative characterisation of proline cis and trans conformers in a disordered peptide

These metadynamic molecular dynamics simulations, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data support the findings of the manuscript entitled 'An integrative characterisation of proline cis and trans conformers of a disordered peptide' by Pettitt et al. 

## This repository contains:
1. `Metadynamic_simulations` directory containing two subdirectories. `Analysis` contains the scripts and data to repeat the metadynamics simulations analysis and reproduce the simulation figures. `PLUMED_input_files` contains the files to rerun the metadynamics simulations. 
2. `NMR` directory contains scripts to reproduce all NMR figures in the manuscript.
