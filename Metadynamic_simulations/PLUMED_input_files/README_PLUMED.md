These are the PLUMED input files used to produce the simulations as reported in 'An integrative characterisation of proline cis and trans conformers in a disordered peptide' by Pettitt et al. 

There are four subdirectories containing relevant input files to rerun the simulations for the `a03ws_run1`, `a03ws_run2`, `a99sb`, and `C36m simulations`. 

We used PLUMED version 2.7.1 and GROMCS 2021.2. All the data and PLUMED input files required to reproduce the simulation results are available on PLUMED-NEST.

These files include: Force field parameters, collective variables, plumed input files, topology files, run files, starting conformations (gro_files.tar.xz), and pdb files for each system.
